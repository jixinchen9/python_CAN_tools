I present a collection of some tools for manipulating CANalyzer format J1939 CAn logs, developed beginning in spring 2024; edited for readability.

In general, processes describe some specific task being done to the data, like writing more power perecnt messages or calculating bus load, while tools contain the functions used to achieve that purpose.
